# 🌍 CFC Performance Insights Vizathon ⚽

## Overview
This project is a platform designed to track, analyze, and visualize the physical performance of football players. It helps coaches and teams monitor key metrics such as load demand, injury history, physical capabilities, and recovery status. The platform integrates various data sources and visualizes critical insights through Power BI dashboards.

## Power BI Pages
1. **📊 Load Demand & Biography**: Visualizes the load demand (games, training, availability) along with player biography information such as nationality, position, team, and league.
2. **🚶 GPS Data**: Provides insights into GPS-based performance metrics, such as speed, distance, and acceleration, to assess the player's movement demands and physical output.
3. **💪 Recovery**: Monitors player recovery status, including sleep, nutrition, wellness, and adherence to recovery strategies.
4. **🏋️‍♂️ Physical Capabilities**: Analyzes players' physical abilities, fitness test results, and strength and conditioning progress.
5. **🎯 Priority Areas**: Highlights the player's priority areas, identified through collaboration with the Performance Support Team, to guide focus areas for improvement.

## Project Workflow
1. **🔄 Data Preprocessing & Mock Data Generation**: A Python script is used both for data preprocessing and to generate mock data. This includes cleaning, normalizing, and formatting the raw data, as well as creating additional mock data to supplement the existing datasets.
2. **📥 Power BI Integration**: The processed and mock data is imported into Power BI, where various dashboards are created. These dashboards visualize key performance metrics for players and coaches, helping to monitor and improve player performance.
3. **📈 Data Visualization**: Multiple Power BI pages visualize the dataset:
   - **📊 Load Demand & Biography**: A unified view of the load demands and player biography details.
   - **🚶 GPS Data**: Performance insights based on GPS metrics.
   - **💪 Recovery**: Player recovery data visualized through recovery tests and wellness metrics.
   - **🏋️‍♂️ Physical Capabilities**: A dashboard summarizing physical tests and strength & conditioning details.
   - **🎯 Priority Areas**: A page dedicated to identifying and visualizing player-specific focus areas for improvement.

## Project Context
This work is part of the **CFC Performance Insights Vizathon**, held from 17th March to 14th April 2025. The challenge is to create the most compelling physical performance interface for elite football players and their coaches, focusing on the following modules:
- **⚡ Load Demand**
- **🩹 Injury History**
- **🏋️‍♀️ Physical Development**
- **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Biography**
- **💤 Recovery**
- **🌍 External Factors**

The project uses a mix of **mock datasets provided by Chelsea FC** and additional data generated via Python preprocessing and mock data creation. These datasets are visualized using Power BI to deliver a user-friendly interface with impactful insights.
